It was created on 23 November 2014 by me when I learned Java.
This version introduced as it was done back in 2014, but includes some minor changes. The original version was not a maven project and without a base package as 'com.vkhazan.jspaceinvaders'. The resources stored in packages beside the code and etc. And I updated and cleaned redundant comments, which seemed to me funny an that time.
